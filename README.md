## 📌 About

Product Hunt doesn’t provide filters for its product lists, which makes it hard to find the products you actually care about. This extension makes it easier to remove irrelevant products so you can focus only on what matters to you.

---

## ✨ Features

- Filter based on texts from: Title, Description, Tags, URL
- Filter "Coming Soon" products
- Filter "Homepage" products
- Filter "Archived" products
